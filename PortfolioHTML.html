			<h3> "When I admire the wonders of a sunset or the beauty of the moon, my soul expands" - Anonymous </h3>

			<p> One of the things I enjoy, is capturing every essence of New York City's beauty. From the sunsets to the sunrises, New York exhibits its potential to be a unique canvas, a canvas that was worked on by a grand designer. I can't help but relish in the magnificent views I am bestowed with on a daily basis, hence why I decide to capture ever moment of it as seen below. These pictures offer an insight into my life. As they exude vibrant colors, they directly reflect my personality. </p>
